# Phanto-IDP: A model for precise and fast IDP backbone generation

![Phanto-IDP](./ImgSrc/Phanto-IDP.png)

Phanto-IDP is a VAE-based generative deep learning model, which aims to **precisely reconstruct** IDP conformation ensembles  and **generate** unseen structures **at a rather high speed**. This is a raw version of Phanto-IDP uploaded for further tests.
